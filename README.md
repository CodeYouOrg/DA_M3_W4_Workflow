# Superstore Sales Workflow Tutorial

This project is designed to simulate a real-world data analytics workflow from start to finish. Using a retail sales dataset, you’ll step into the role of a data analyst preparing data for insight — learning how to clean, model, query, and visualize information using tools common in the field: Python, Pandas, SQLite, and Seaborn.

The lesson emphasizes both technical and conceptual understanding. As you move through the notebook, you’ll explore how relational database design helps reduce redundancy, enforce consistency, and make analysis more powerful. You’ll also practice writing SQL queries and turning those results into compelling visual stories.

By the end, you’ll have a working SQLite database, a polished Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and a collection of visualizations that connect the data to real business questions — demonstrating your ability to think through an analytical process from raw data to insight.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you’ll work directly with the popular [**Superstore Sales Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales) - a rich, multi-dimensional dataset published on Kaggle by *Ishan Shrivastava*. This dataset simulates real retail sales and contains information about orders, products, customers, and shipping details across multiple regions and time periods. It’s widely used for practicing data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence workflows.

You’ll begin by inspecting and cleaning the raw CSV file, ensuring that data types, formatting, and consistency are correct. Next, you’ll identify repeating entities (such as customers, orders, and products) and design an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to represent how those entities connect. Once your design is finalized, you’ll create an **SQLite database** using Python and Pandas, splitting the dataset into properly structured tables.

With your database complete, you’ll practice writing **SQL queries** to explore sales performance across different dimensions - such as customer categories, product profitability, and regional sales. Finally, you’ll visualize your findings using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, transforming your SQL results into clear, engaging graphics.

This project mirrors a real-world data workflow: from *raw CSV → relational design → SQL analysis → visualization*. It reinforces good data practices, storytelling with visuals, and the ability to turn raw information into meaningful insights.
